# Firefox start page
This is my small project that you can use/edit for your Firefox's home page.
I recommend use this home page with *New tab override* extension and with custom http server.

## Tinkering
### Search engine
You can edit main.js:84 on whatever search engine you want.
### Weather
There is two cities already configured by default. If you want to change it, then I recommend you to use open-meteo.com (free service).
### Quick buttons
You can use default buttons as a template. I suggest you to 128px images for button's icon (if not you can just delete that <img> and keep button with text).
### MOTD
There is MOTD (message of the day) right up from search bar. You can change array of MOTD's at main.js:48
